**Quote of the day**

> *A program is like a poem: you cannot write a poem without writing it. Yet people talk about programming as if it were a production process and measure „programmer productivity“ in terms of „number of lines of code produced“. In so doing they book that number on the wrong side of the ledger: We should always refer to „the number of lines of code spent“.* - **Edsger W. Dijkstra**
